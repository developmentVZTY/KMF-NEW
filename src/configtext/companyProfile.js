    description: `Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation Limited (KMF) is the Apex Body for the dairy co-operative movement in Karnataka. It is the second largest dairy co-operative amongst the dairy cooperatives in the country. In South India it stands first in terms of procurement as well as sales. One of the core functions of the Federation is marketing of Milk and Milk Products. The Brand "Nandini" is the household name for Pure and Fresh milk and milk products. KMF has 16 Milk Unions covering all the districts of the State which procure milk from Primary Dairy Cooperative Societies(DCS) and distribute milk to the consumers in various Towns/Cities/Rural markets in Karnataka.`

    description: `Karnataka Dairy Development Cooperation(KDDC), the first ever World Bank/ International Development Agency funded Dairy Development Program in the country started in Karnataka on co-operative lines with the organisation of Village Level Dairy Co-operatives in 1974. The AMUL pattern of dairy co-operatives started functioning in Karnataka from 1974-75 with the financial assistance from World Bank/IDA, Operation Flood II & III. The Anand Pattern three tier organisation structure – Dairy Cooperative Societies at the village level, District Milk Unions at the District level to take care of the procurement, processing and marketing of milk and provide technical input services for enhancing milk production at producers level and Federation at the state level to co-ordinate the growth of the sector in the State, are resolutely and harmoniously working hand-in-hand in creating self-sustaining rural economy based on cooperative dairying. KMF is one of the few federations in the country, who have converted dairying from a subsidiary occupation into an industry.`

    description: `Coordination of activities among the Unions and developing market for Milk and Milk products is the responsibility of KMF. Marketing Milk in the respective jurisdiction is organized by the respective Milk Unions. Surplus/deficit of liquid milk among the member Milk Unions is monitored by the Federation. While the marketing of all the Milk Products is organized by KMF, both within and outside the State, all the Milk and Milk products are sold under a common brand name NANDINI.`
  },
  {
    description: `The Federation is striving to create a self-reliant and vibrant rural economy in Karnataka by providing a supportive and conducive environment for the growth of Dairy Cooperatives as autonomous economic and social institutions. The Federation is largely successful in realizing the objectives of dairying during the last four decades of dairy development in Karnataka State. It is by-and-large successful in providing a viable subsidiary occupation to unemployed rural poor so as to raise their income earning capacities and to supply adequate quantity of quality milk at reasonable prices to urban consumers.`
  },
  {
    description:`The results of effective dairy development by KMF have made a far-reaching and extensive impact on the rural landscape in Karnataka. The best remunerative milk purchase price to farmers, efficient and timely input services, delivered at the door-steps to farmers, such as, unfailing veterinary health services to any remote village, quality artificial insemination for breed improvements, supply of balanced cattle feed at less than the market price, etc., have made the farmers to increasingly patronize their cooperative. The extent of patronization by farmers is so complete, that the dominant share of marketable surplus milk of farmers in Karnataka is procured by KMF dairies and hardly there is any organized private dairy milk procurement, which is widely prevalent in other parts of the country.
